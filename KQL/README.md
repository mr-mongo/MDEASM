# MDEASM

KQL samples for MDEASM data in Log Analytics and Azure Data Explorer.  
These are all extracted from the queries in the workbook and some of them still contain references to the workbook parameters (pretty much any query that offered different sorting and grouping options).  
Since those cannot be fixed without more manual intervention than I am willing to take, I have left them as-is and it will be up to you to adjust the queries to remove or modify them as your needs dictate.
